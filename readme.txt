How to Run Logistic Regression:

Make the following changes before Compile/Run

Train Dataset: Change the value of the variable reader with your file in LR.java
Test Dataset: Change the value of the variable reader1 with your file in LR.java
Learning Rate: Change the value for the variable 'eeta' with your value in LR.java

For some values of eeta, it takes more time to converge, so please be patient. 

Then Compile the code and Run to see the results.
